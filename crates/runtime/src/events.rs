//! Adapted from <https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/blob/da39c7195107d8211f21c263e4084f773b84eaff/YarnSpinner/Dialogue.cs>, which we split off into multiple files
//!
//! ## Implementation notes
//!
//! - `OptionSet` was replaced by a simple `Vec<DialogueOption>`
//! - Additional newtypes were introduced for strings.
